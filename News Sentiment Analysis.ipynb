      " Vijay Mallya has applied to Home Secretary Priti Patel for “another route” to be able to stay in the U.K., the liquor tycoon’s barrister representing him in bankruptcy proceedings in the High Court in London confirmed during a remote hearing on January 22.The 65-year-old businessman, whose legal challenge to the Indian government’s extradition request was turned down at the Supreme Court level in the U.K. last year, remains in Britain on bail until Ms. Patel signs off on the order for him to be extradited to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering related to the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.\n",

      "Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced on Wednesday evening, after more than 10 rounds of talks with farmers unions, that the government was ready to suspend the implementation of the three contentious farm laws. With that, the government hoped that the unions, determined to take out a tractor rally on Republic Day would rethink their months-long agitation and vacate their blockade of the national capital.The reasons for the government’s compromise formula are not hard to find. The continued strike by farmers’ unions, especially the ones hailing from Punjab and Haryana, the imminent nature of R- Day celebrations and the Supreme Court’s refusal to ban a proposed tractor rally were just the immediate reasons for the compromise formula.\n",
